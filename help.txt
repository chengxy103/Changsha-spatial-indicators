Calculate and report on indicators for healthy, sustainable cities worldwide in four steps: configure, analysis, generate and compare.

1. Configure your study region

configure [codename]

Entering this command will generate a template configuration file (/process/configuration/regions/[condename].yml) that can be edited in a text editor to configure parameters, data sources and metadata for a study region of interest, referred to using a short 'codename'.

2. Conduct analysis for your configured study region

analysis [codename]

This collates the data and undertakes analysis using the completed study region configuration file, calculating a suite of spatial urban indicators.

3. Generate datasets, documentation, maps and reports for your study region

generate [codename]

Generated files will be located in the folder: process/data/_study_region_outputs/[codename]

4. Compare the generated results of two study regions

compare [reference codename] [comparison codename]

Each of the steps (configure, analysis, generate, compare) needs to be successfully completed before moving to the next.

For more directions on each step, run the command omitting the study region codename.

To run the provided example analysis for Las Palmas, Spain, use the codename:
example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023

The software can be run in different ways.  For use in your web browser, type and enter:
  - ghsci (to launch an interactive app at http://localhost:8080)
  - lab (to view an example Python notebook, or create your own, within Jupyter Lab at http://localhost:8000)

To run the software at the commandline, see the additional details on the four step process listed further above.

To run the software within Python or a Jupyter notebook:

from subprocesses import ghsci
codename = 'your_region_codename'
ghsci.configure(codename)
# Now you need to open the generated yml file (e.g. in Jupyter Lab), source your data and configure it
# Once you have configured your study region, you can proceed:
r = ghsci.Region(codename)
r.analysis()
r.generate()
# you can compare with another region once you have successfully run analysis and generated resources for both
r.compare('example_ES_Las_Palmas_2023')

To exit, type and enter: exit
